# by default, initial startup:
# 1. how much did you make this month?
# 2. how much did you spend today?
# eventually can be configured for daily/weekly income and prompt after +1, +7 days/every monday etc.
# 
# by default, subsequent startup for remainder of this month
# 1. how much did you spend today?
#
# However, this inital model doesn't account for interest income or investment income etc. TODO

# user interface notes: 
# if you don't respond to the date prompt, default is today
# at the date prompt you can also say '-1' to indicate yesterday, etc.
# scope creep: implement "yesterday" "two days ago" "on saturday"?
